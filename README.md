# Alluvial Deposit

Alluvial is the world's worst search engine, written in support of a conference
talk called "Browser History Confessional: Searching My Recent Searches".

## Abstract

We all only have so much working memory available in our brains. Developers may joke about spending their day composing search engine queries. The reason it's a joke is because of the truth behind it. Search-driven development is a reality.

Join me, and my actual search history, on a journey to solve recent challenges I faced. I'll categorize the different types of information I often search for. You'll leave with tips on retrieving the knowledge you need for your next bug, feature, or pull request.
